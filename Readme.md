# Design Patterns 

The goal here is to implement as many design patterns as possible in PHP (very simplified).

## Pre-requisites

- php >= 7.0
- composer

## Installation
There are no packages to install, Composer was only used for autoloading.
- run the following to generate autoload files and the vendor folder `composer du -o`

## Running the code 

To run any of the examples, cd into the folder and run the `index.php`
for instance, to run the observer pattern example:

- Change directory into the observer folder `cd observer`
- Run the index.php `php index.php`
